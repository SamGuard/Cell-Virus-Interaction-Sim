# Todo List

## Development


## Write-up
- Just gotta do it really
- Sensitivity and other analysis of the ABM
- Change state variable names
- Update model section to include more about params

## Data collection
- Find data on Influenza A that can be used to compare to the results from your simulation
- Run batches of tests to see what parameters work the best to imitate the virus
- Compile data and write about the findings
