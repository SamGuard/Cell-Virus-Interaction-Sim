# Todo List

## Development
- Implement innate cells destroying infected cells
- See if there are any other cells to add in
- Make script to run batches of simulations with different parameters

## Write-up
- Figure out how you want to structure the report, think of headings and split the work up well.
- Add more todo's here after the step above^

## Data collection
- Find data on a virus (probably influenza A) that can be used to compare to the results from your simulation
- Run batches of tests to see what parameters work the best to imitate the virus
- Compile data and write about the findings
