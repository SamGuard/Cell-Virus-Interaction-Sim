# Todo List

## Development
- Implement innate cells destroying infected cells
- Implement code that runs batches of tests
- See if there are any other cells to add in
- Add flag in model.props that enables/disables tracking of positions and states
- Change cell params
- Change human params

## Write-up
- Just gotta do it really
- Sensitivity and other analysis of the ABM

## Data collection
- Find data on Influenza A that can be used to compare to the results from your simulation
- Run batches of tests to see what parameters work the best to imitate the virus
- Compile data and write about the findings
